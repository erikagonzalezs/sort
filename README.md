# sort
C program made with processes and threads, it just sorts a bunch of files and creates a final file with all the other file sorted.
It takes every file and sorts it separating them in different processes or threads.

csortp - sort with processes
csorth - sort with threads

You need a folder named "temp" for it to work!!!!
